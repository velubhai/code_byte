Given three distinct integers a b and c, write a C program to find the second
largest number among them.

Input
Three distinct integers a b c.
The first input is the integer a.
The second input is the integer b.
The third input is is the integer c.

Output
The second largest among a, b and c

Note: The assignment evaluation is automated.
Therefore, do not print (using printf) anything other than the output value.


Statements such as printf("Enter the first integer") printf("The second largest integer is %d", val) etc will lead to incorrect output.
Ideally, the only printf line in the code should be printf("%d",val); Here val can be any variable that stores the output value.

Sample input
------------------
 2 3 1

Sample output
-------------------
2

Explanation
----------------
2 is the second largest among {2, 3 , 1}.
1 < 2 and 2 < 3.
Select the Language for this assignment. 
C


source code

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   int a, b, c;
    scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
    int second;
    if ((a > b && a < c) || (a > c && a < b)) {
        second = a;
    } else if ((b > a && b < c) || (b > c && b < a)) {
        second = b;
    } else {
        second = c;
    }
    printf(" %d", second);
    return 0;
}
