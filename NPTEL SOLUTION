Solution





 #i n cl u d e <s t d i o . h>
 i n t main ( )
 {
i n t hundreds , ten s , one s ;
 i n t p r i c e ;
 i n t money ;

s c a n f ( ”%d”,& hundreds ) ;
 s c a n f ( ”%d”,& t e n s ) ;
 s c a n f ( ”%d”,& one s ) ;
 s c a n f ( ”%d”,& p r i c e ) ;

 money = hundreds ∗100 + t e n s ∗10 + one s ;

 i f ( p r i c e <= money ) {
